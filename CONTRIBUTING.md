## Testing in development using ngrok

To test that the Let's Encrypt API is working correctly,
I recommend the following steps.

1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.io), a command-line tool for creating a publically accessible tunnel to your computer.

2. Start ngrok by running `ngrok http -bind-tls=false 5000`. This will create a temporary, public URL `http://TMP.ngrok.io`

3. Edit your hosts file to redirect http://TMP.ngrok.io to localhost
    ```
    sudo vim /etc/hosts
    ```

    Add a new line for "127.0.0.1  TMP.ngrok.io"

4. Update Let's Encrypt Set your app to use Let's Encrypt staging environment so you don't hit rate limits in generating certificates.

```csharp
    .UseLetsEncrypt(o =>
    {
        o.HostNames = new[] { "TMP.ngrok.io" };
        o.UseStagingServer = true; // <--- use staging

        o.AcceptTermsOfService = true;
        o.EmailAddress = "admin@example.com";
    })
```

5. `dotnet run` your application.

And voila! The API should automatically provision and create an HTTPs certificate for TMP.ngrok.io.


## Trusting dev certs from Let's Encrypt

By default, certificates generated by Let's Encrypt's staging certificates will not appear as a trusted certificate.

To trust a test certificate, on macOS

1. Open up "Keychain Access" and search for your certificate.

2. Right click on the certificate on click "Get Info"

3. Under the "Trust" section, change the drop-down to "Trust" and **close the info window**. This should prompt you for a password.
